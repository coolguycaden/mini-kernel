## CadenOS Bootloader
Basic 16-bit x86 bootloader.

## Project Description
A minimalist 16-bit x86 bootloader written in Assembly. 

## To-do
- load more sectors into memory
- lift from 16 bit real mode to 32 bit protected mode
- upgrade from assembly to C 

## Work Process
Currently, I set some time aside to work on this project by engaging with the two book resources I listed. I try to implement their challenges while turning their example code into my own. 

## Goals
- Proficiency with Assembly
- Simple text editor + file system
- Eventually turn into mini-kernel 

## Stretch Goals 
- Number 1 most used kernel in the world
- Solve world hunger
- Found intergalatic empire focusing on human supremacy
