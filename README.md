## CadenOS Bootloader
Basic 16-bit x86 bootloader and minimalist shell environment.

## Project Description
A minimalist 16-bit x86 bootloader and "micro-kernel" written in Assembly. It initializes a stack, sets up memory segments, and provides a basic command-line interface (CLI) environment. The system utilizes BIOS interrupts to interact with the user via a persistent input loop.

## To-do 
- work through both of the books listed, attempting to understand concepts and write them in code

## Goals
- Proficiency with Assembly
- Simple text editor + file system
- Eventually turn into mini-kernel 

## Stretch Goals 
- Number 1 most used kernel in the world
- Solve world hunger
- Found intergalatic empire focusing on human supremacy
